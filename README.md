# Hotel Aalto
 This was one of my first projects when I learned to use HTML and CSS. It's a very straight-forward site. Keeping the styling very simple and clean, the idea was to give the images prominence. 

 The index page has images which fade into each other on a loop. This was done using keyframes.
